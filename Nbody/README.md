# BlackHolesDarkDress - Simulations



### Requirements

Requires `pyGadgetReader` - available [here](http://ascl.net/1411.001).

### Downloading the results

To keep the size of this repo manageable, the `Gadget-2` snapshots are archived on FigShare: [doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.6300110](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6300110).

To download and unpack all of the N-body results into the `sims/` folder, simply run the script `GetAllSnapshots.sh`. But beware that the total size of the snapshots is around 25 GB and may take an hour or so to download. 

To download one example simulation (~1-2 GB), simply run`GetExampleSnapshot.sh`.

Alternatively you can visit [doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.6300110](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6300110) and download the individual simulations.
